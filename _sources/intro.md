# Materials Informatics 101

Informatics is the use of computational tools (e.g. AI, machine learning) to access and make sense of data. Materials Informatics has the potential to accelerate scientific inquiry and support novel insights. However, informatics tools are typically marketed to the biological sciences, financial sector, and "Big Tech"---it is not immediately clear how to use "cat-detector technology" to support serious materials science!

The materials on this site are part of a hands-on workshop aimed at training material scientists to use programming-based informatics tools. In this workshop, you will create reproducible data workflows, automate tedious data extraction, visualize data for exploration, and apply AI/ML models for their predictive capabilities.
