In place of a notebook, we will have a full-group activity. See the
[Slides](slides) page for a link to the slides (for your reference).

This [conference talk by John
Rauser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSgEeI2Xpdc) is one of the greatest
resources on effective data visualization I've ever seen. Much of what I've
learned is from this talk. I can't recommend it highly enough.
