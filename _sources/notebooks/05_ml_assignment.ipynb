    "The _primary_ purpose of this notebook is to help you *not get fooled by machine learning*! As Drew Conway notes, possessing hacking skills and substantive experience---but having no math or statistics background---puts one in the [danger zone](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram). While we can't possibly cover *everything* you need in a single workshop, this exercise will highlight some of the challenges of doing machine learning well. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning outcomes\n",
    "By working through this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use grama to work with models.\n",
    "- Understand the importance of *underfitting* and *overfitting*\n",
    "- Use cross-validation to help avoid *underfitting* and *overfitting*\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This exercise heavily uses the [py-grama](https://github.com/zdelrosario/py_grama) package; you can find more info on the [documentation site](https://py-grama.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "- This exercise indirectly uses [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/); you can find lots of useful info on this package on their [documentation site](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html).\n"
