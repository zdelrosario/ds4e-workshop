# Principles of Visualization

In place of a notebook, we will have a full-group activity. The slides are linked on the [slides](slides) page. If you're looking for a link to the feedback survey for this activity, [click here](https://forms.gle/PpoKEGgjPfkPtTn86).

This [conference talk by John Rauser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSgEeI2Xpdc) is one of the greatest resources on effective data visualization I've ever seen. Much of what I've learned is from this talk. I can't recommend it highly enough.
