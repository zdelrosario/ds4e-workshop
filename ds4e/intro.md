# Data Science for Engineers (2023 Workshop)

This is the website for the Data Science for Engineers 2023 summer kickoff workshop. The workshop will be held on Saturday June 24 and Sunday June 25. This page gives important information for participating in the workshop.

## Getting set up

Please make sure to follow the [software setup](https://zdelrosario.github.io/ds4e-workshop/setup.html) instructions prior to the workshop.

## Schedule

The following table give the schedule for the kickoff workshop.

Note that the Saturday activities will be offered live in both the morning and early evening; this is to maximize the number of people who can attend the first day of activities. You only need to attend one block, as the content will be identical.

For Sunday, the only block that will be offered is in the morning. However, I will record the sessions and send all materials to participants. (Unfortunately, I have some logistical travel difficulties that evening---I need to catch a plane!)

Workshop activities will take varied formats:

- *Lecture* will involve me introducing ideas with slides, but I'll keep people engaged by asking you all questions.
- A *Guided activity* will involve me demonstrating how to do something using software tools, while you get a chance to do this work on your own computer.
- *Guided programming* is similar to a guided activity, but this emphasizes that we'll be doing programming in Python.
- There will be optional *programming homework* between the workshop days; this is an opportunity to dig deeper into the material!
- We will hold *office hours* before the workshop to help with any software installation woes. We'll try to make sure you can particpate fully in the workshop!

## Professional development course

After the workshop, you can continue learning through a 4-week professional development course that will elaborate on the topics from the workshop. We'll send instructions after the workshop on how to sign up for the course!

<!-- ## Binder Option for Broken Python Installation -->

<!-- If you haven't managed to get your python installation working, use the following link to launch the materials in a cloud-based environment: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zdelrosario/mi101/build) -->

<!-- **Be warned that you cannot save your work in Binder!** -->
