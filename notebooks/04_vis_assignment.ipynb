One of the caveats of UMAP is that the coordinates themselves do not have a simple interpretation, so the location of clusters in the two coordinates fairly arbitrary. The distances between clusters is also not necessarily meaningful. A well-calibrated UMAP will tend to reveal clustering in the data, in which case points nearby in UMAP space can be understood to be close in the original space.\n",
